  id: LargeWhiteKing
  name: white king
  description: The white king, it can move one square in any direction. If the no piece can move and this piece is threatened, then black wins; however, if it is not under threat and no piece can move then the game ends in a stalemate.

  id: LargeWhiteQueen
  name: white queen
  description: The white queen, it can move any amount of tiles in any direction. The most powerful piece on the board, it can be tempting to always promote a pawn to a queen, but this can lead to a stalemate if not handled carefully. Worth 9 points.

  id: LargeWhiteRook
  name: white rook
  description: The white rook, it can move any amount of tiles orthogonally. If neither the king nor the rook of the same colour have moved, and there are no pieces inbetween them, then the rook can be moved one square towards the king and the king is moved to where the rook previously was; this is called castling. Worth 5 points.

  id: LargeWhiteBishop
  name: white bishop

  id: LargeWhitePawn
  name: white pawn
  description: The white pawn, it moves one tile toward the opposing side of the board, but can move two if it has not moved yet in the game. It cannot take a piece by moving straight into it like the other pieces, but has to be diagonally adjacent. If it reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to a knight, bishop, rook or queen. Worth 1 point.
